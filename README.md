Hackathon Project

The More than Meets the Eye MtMtEye-app is pinpointing Wikipedia-generated (local) references on a Google Maps, and then generating links to thousands of related images in UB Leiden's Special Collections. It doesn’t matter where you are in the world; browsing Google Maps and Google Street View will take you to the Leiden catalogue with its rich collections.

Better still, the same code can be used by any library or museum so they, too, can provide easy links to their collections without any hassle.

Now: link to UB Leiden Special Collections (Leiden local catalogue). 

Extras, to be developed:
    - Pins in Streetview with own LOGO or brand;
    - Second and third links to images in Flickr, Google;
    - More links to collections of 071-members

Future: link to other collections (to be adapted by institutions which wants to use our code)


The MtMtEye-app is developed by the UBL Hackathon ‘Team DiscoverSC’.
